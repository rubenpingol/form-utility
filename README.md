# Form Utility
Simple form utility library.


This form utility library aims to provide developers a time-efficient way of handling common form events, like:
* Form Validation
* Form Submission
* Grid Row Form *(within a Table)*

But having still the full-control of what happens next after an event happened.

### Basic Dependencies
* Bootstrap version 4 *(used for form theme and validation classes)*

### Optional Dependencies
* Select2 *(If you like to render `<select>` tag differently from the default **Bootstrap** theme)*
* jQuery *(For you to load the **Select2**)*
